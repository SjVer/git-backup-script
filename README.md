# git-backup-script
A simple script that lets you backup your files automatically

>>> How to use:
1. Edit the code so that it includes your git remote, links, etc.
2. Add your own exception paths to the script as well. THIS IS HIGHLY RECCOMENDED. (The script will not backup these paths.)
3. Make sure you got your git credentials automated for optimal use
4. Install termcolor with pip (it's a python module)
5. Make the script executable
6. (Optional) Bind the execution to an alias
7. Done!
(It might need more tweaking but i'm no professional so yea.)
